# VariableByteCodeEncoder

A Java program that converts positive decimal numbers into Variable Byte Code (VBC) representations. 
VBC ensures that the binary representation of a number is encoded in bytes with each byte marked to indicate if it's the last in the sequence.

Example:

Please enter a decimal number: 300

The Variable Byte Code of 300 is: 10101100
